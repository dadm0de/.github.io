## **Starship Configuration Files [WIP]**
This repository contains two Starship (.toml) configuration files to help you customize your Starship.RS prompt:

### **StarshipRS_Default.toml**: 
This file provides a well-commented template containing most of the default Starship settings. It serves as a helpful starting point for creating your own custom configuration file.

### **starshipRScustomize.toml**: 
This file includes only the configurations that affect the look and feel of Starship, such as colors and fonts. It allows for easy customization without changing core functionality.

***Note:*** These are not official Starship configuration files, but rather user-created configurations to aid in setting up your Starship prompt.

I hope you find these files helpful!
